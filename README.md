# chat_PDF for research paper

The aim of this project is to develop a question-answering system similar to ChatPDF(https://www.chatpdf.com/).
And our system is mainly focused on research papers in the field of AI. We aim to get accurate answers from long PDF efficentlly.

Our question-answering system is able to handle 3 kinds of questions related to PDF:
1. Direct query questions that can be matched to the text in the paragraph.
2. Indirect query questions without specific keywords in the text.
3. Identification of key references that inspire the proposed methodology in the paper(innovation point).

`main.py` are the final running code, users can interact with the system in terminal. 
`final_test.ipynb` is the final test version on Notebook, where shows more results of the intermediate steps.

__Detailed structures and sample running result shows in `chatPDF.pdf`__
